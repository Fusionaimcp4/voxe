The planet Veridion-7 orbits a twin star system called Solara Prime and Solara Minor. It has three moons, each with a unique color: Azure, Crimson, and Goldleaf. The planetâ€™s atmosphere contains a rare gas called luminite, which glows faintly at night, making the landscapes shimmer in blue and green hues.
